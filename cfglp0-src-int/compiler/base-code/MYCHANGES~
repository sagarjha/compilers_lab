Assignment 5b) (compiler generating optimised intermediate and SPIM code for level 1)

a) scanner.ll
   Used directly from assignment 2b

b) parser.yy, parser.h and parser.ih
   Used directly from assignment 2b. 

c) ast.cc	
   Function compile_and_optimize_ast(Lra_Outcome) was defined for Relational_Expression_Ast and Conditional_Ast, the two new types of Asts needed to support Level 1. Also, a tweak was made to Assignment_Ast::compile_and_optimize_ast(Lra_Outcome) was made, to handle the case when the right hand side is not a singleton expression, differently.

d) reg-alloc.cc
   optimize_lra(Lra_Outcome) function saw some small changes to accommodate the possibility of Relational_Expression_Ast appearing on the RHS of an assignment statement. Also, the code for optionally freeing the destination register was moved into the case mc_2r
