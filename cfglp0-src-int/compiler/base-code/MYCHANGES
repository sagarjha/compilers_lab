Assignment 6a) (compiler generating intermediate code for level 2)

a) scanner.ll
   Used directly from assignment 3a

b) parser.yy, parser.h and parser.ih
   Used directly from assignment 3a with some changes like giving the correct operator (e.g. uminus or uminus_d etc.)

c) ast.cc & ast.hh
   First copied the classes from assignment 3a. Then, defined the compile function in cast_assignment_ast and cast_name_ast and cast_expr_ast.
   
d) reg-alloc.cc & reg-alloc.hh
   Added instruction lookups for add, add.d, mul etc. Also, for load.d, store.d, etc.
   Register_Val_Type enum was expanded to contain float_num as well.
   Spim_Register enum is expanded to contain floating point registers f2 through f30.
   Modified the function Machine_Description::get_new_register so that register allocation is done as per type

e) symbol-table.hh and symbol-table.cc
   expanded the Data_Type enum to include float_data_type and double_data_type
   modified the Symbol_Table::get_size_of_value_type to return the size of float as 8.

f) local-environment.hh and local-environment.cc
   changes are as per assignment 3a
