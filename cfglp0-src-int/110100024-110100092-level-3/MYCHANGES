Assignment 4a) (parser for level 3)

a) parser.yy
   
1) We added the rules for recognizing function declarations and definitions. 
2) We allowed for the possibility of expressions containing functional calls as well as expressions as arguments of functional calls. 
3) Also, made arrangements so that statements can consist solely of functional calls. 
4) We made return statements more general (allowing the possibility of them returning expressions).

Some finer points-
Function definitions are allowed as "float sum(float a, float b)" or "float sum(float, float)", though a valid CFG will contain one of the first type. However, a function declaration is required by us to be necessarily present before its definition.

b) scanner.ll
   We added rule to recognize the keyword void and added ',' in META_CHAR
