Assignment 3b) (complete assignment for level 2)

a) parser.yy
   We added the actions in the extra non-terminals we had added in the first part of the assignment. This takes care of the actions that need to be performed when artithmetic operations are detected, or when a type cast is encountered.

b) ast.hh
   We created two extra classes Cast_Expr_Ast, Cast_Assignment_Ast and Cast_Name_Ast to take care of casted expressions, assignments and names respectively.

c) ast.cc
   We defined the member functions of the 3 extra classes defined in ast.hh including get_data_type, print_ast, get_value_of_evaluation and evaluate.

d) local-environment.hh
   We defined two extra classes eval_Result_Value_Float and eval_Result_Value_Double to store result of expressions of type float and double. Also, the return data type of the get_value function of the base class Eval_Result was made float.

e) local-environment.cc
   We defined the member functions of the two extra class defined in local-environment.hh.

f) procedure.cc
   We added extra code to check if a return statement has encountered and if yes, we exit at the time of evaluation.
